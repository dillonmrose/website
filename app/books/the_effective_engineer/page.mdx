# The Effective Engineer
### by Edmond Lau

# Part 1 : Mindset

#### Chapter 1

Effectiveness = Value per time unit of work

Leverage = Impact produce / time invested

80-20 rule : 80% of impact comes from 20% of work

 



Increase Leverage in 3 Ways

Reducing time to complete an activity
How can I complete this activity with less time
Increase output of an activity
How we can I increase the value produced by this activity
Shift to higher leverage activities
Is there something else I could be spending my time on that is more leveraged
 

Q: How does awareness of leverage effect the way we should interact with LT

 

#### Chapter 2

Optimizing for learning is one of the highest leverage things you can do

 

Failures are growth opportunities

 

What to look for/promote:

Fast growth
Training
Openness
Pace
People
Autonomy
 

20% time to develop new skills

Adjacent disciplines

Study Code
Write code
Go through technical documentation
Master the programming language
Send code reviews to harshest critics
Enroll in classes
Participate in design discussion - ask to be invited
Work on a diversity of projects
Make sure your team has some people for you to learn from
Be fearless
 

#### Chapter 3

Prioritize regularly

Prioritizing is a high leverage task because it determines the leverage of your other tasks

 

Track to-dos in a singular accessible list

To-do list should be

Canonical list of work
Accessible
Prioritized
Visited
Is there something else I can do that is higher leverage?

 

Focus on what directly produces value and the important non-urgent

Examples of important non-urgent

Planning

Building relationships

Personal development

Limit the amount of in progress work

Say NO to work

Increasing work linearly increases the failure rate exponentially

Limit context switching

 

If-Then Plans

Identify ahead of time a situation where you plan to do the task

 

Part 2 : Strategies for progress

 

#### Chapter 4: Invest in iteration speed

 

Increasing iteration speed has cascading effects. Completely changes workflow. Less time planning. Less time creating studies. Just ship it. 

  Building tools. Faster build times. Less time reading code. Now you can just try to build. Repo builds need to be fast. 

 

New tools may speed up others but there is a switching cost. Invest in reducing the switching cost. Julia’s refactor. 

 

Proving your tool saves time buys you leeway in the future to do bigger changes. You need to build trust. Long term impact is hard to quantify but. Short term cost is known. 

 

#### Chapter 5: Measure what you want to improve

 

What to measure and what not to measure

Measuring influences employee behavior. Optimizing for speed and cut quality 

Measurement should be actionable and responsive 

Actionable metrics movements can be casually explained

Vanity metrics are just numbers 

 

Be skeptical of metrics. Try to validate your metrics by arriving at them from a different angle. Back of an envelope 

When a number looks off, dig into it early 

 

#### Chapter 6: Validate your ideas early and often 

 

Ship something small early and get feedback. 

Iterate a little. Validate. Course correct. Loop. 

 

A/B tests help you understand what is better and ideally you can quantify how much better. Which helps you decide whether to keep trying to improve. Only 1% better. Probably not. Way better  let’s do more. 

 

Beware of 1 person teams. You can get bused. No shared knowledge. No oversight project lows are more demoralizing alone. No shares pain. No way to get help 

 

Decisions need feedback loops 

 

#### Chapter 7: Improve your project estimation skills 

 

Large project slips are most often due to many minor unforeseen issues than 1 major issue 

 

Creating specific goals, you can easily decide what work is not in scope. Creates alignment between stakeholders. Hold people accountable for local traders that impact global goals 

 

Concrete milestones with target dates create accountability 

 

Mitigate risk early by tackling risky problems early 

 

Code complexity grows with interactions between lines of code more than lines of code. Sub systems interacting in complex ways create clean touch points/ contracts between components 

 

Approach rewrite projects with extreme caution 

Use a series of incremental behavior preserving transformations 

 

Don’t sprint. An effective engineer is planned ahead 

 

Part 3 : Long term value

#### Chapter 8 Balance Quality with Pragmatism

Good abstraction should be

Easy to learn
Easy to use even without docs
Hard to misuse
Satisfy the requirements
Easy to extend
Appropriate to the audience
 

Determining how to balance how much tests to write vs agility is a high leverage task

Tech debt needs to be repaid

 

#### Chapter 9 Minimize operational burden

Find simple solutions

 

Fail fast

Easier to debug 

Failing slow removes the error context. Muddies the source of the error

 

Report errors to engineers while being graceful for  users 

Automate team processes

 

Being able to rerun your scripts more often reduces false alarms and allows more nuanced issues to be raised 

 

Recover quickly 

We will break. Learn to mitigate major drawn out failures 

Create plans. TSGs before things are broken

 

#### Chapter 10 Invest in Teams growth 

Interviewing 

Ask questions which have High signal to noise ratio 

Iterate on hiring process 

Reflect on current hiring process 

Rapid fire easy questions to cover a wide surface area to filter out 

 

Create a good onboard g process

Have good docs

 

Onboarding should

Ramp up new engineers
Impart team culture and values
Expose new engineers to fundamentals/tools needed to succeed 
Socially integrate the new employee
 

Peer programming and code labs are great tools 

 

Assigning a mentor to new employees that help ramp and assign initial starter tasks 

 

Reflect on what docs I would want available for my team if I were the manager 

 

Share ownership of code

Being a sole owner of code doesn’t increase your value. It makes you a liability 

Becoming the bottleneck of a project reduces your flexibility to pursue other tasks. In order to scale, you need to be able to release ownership successfully 

 

Hold post mortems

Don’t blame

Increase shared knowledge 

Document learnings

Keep docs simple and accessible 

 

Create a good engineering culture

Optimize for iteration speed
Push relentlessly for automation
Build the right abstractions
High code quality 
Good code review process
Respectful work environment
Shared ownership of code 
Automated testing
Allot time for experimentation
Foster a culture of learning and improvement
Hire the best
