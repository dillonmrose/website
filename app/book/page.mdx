## Vercel


I joined [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) early to grow [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and our developer community. I built our Developer Relations team to teach the community about our products.

We spoke at conferences, wrote blog posts, and created videos. We built open-source examples and contributed back to the [product](/n/devtools). We [translated customer pain](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/1105985400110112768) back into the product roadmap. I [shipped](https://x.com/leeerob/status/1841226051554308229) a lot of code.

Since joining Vercel in 2020, Next.js has grown 1000%, now with 1 million active developers. Next.js is one of the top software projects on GitHub and used to build [wonderful products](https://nextjs.org/showcase).
