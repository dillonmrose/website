# Hello
Over the last couple years, I have been reading my way through the hits of Software Engineering.

"The Effective Engineer" bu Edmod Lau, "The Mythical Man-Month" by Fred Brooks, "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann, etc. I started following these authors on social media.

I followed youtubers like Theo Browne and Jeff Delaney. I have been consuming content voraciously.
<br/>
I aspire to produce valuable content like these titans of the industry.

So I'm finally investing in my site. I will be posting notes from the books that I read and interesting findings from my career.
